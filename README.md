# DocumentsProviderSample
A very small sample of how to implement DocumentsProvider, to have new items of Android's file-picker

Note that if you use it, you will have to change a lot.
You need to manage the files hirerchy, including cache of thumbnails (if you need them) and deleting from cache when not needed.
